Dust: Slab dust model
In this model, we assume that stars and dust are homogeneously distributed in an infinite plane-parallel slab with the
same vertical scale. The transmission factor is a function of the internal face-on dust opacity which depends mainly on
the cold gas column density and metallicity of the galaxy (see e.g. Devriendt et al. 1999 for more details).
