(Week 1) Deep 2 Supernovae Rates.ipynb
-> Initial attempt at creating transient models of our SN rates (for const stellar mass and SFR)

(Week 2,3,4,5)DEEP2 SN Rates.ipynb
-> Additon of the TDE Rate equation and improving the code gradually(check history of the file)

(Week 6)Deep 2 Rates.ipynb
-> Further improving the code to create more accurate rates. Creation of Log graphs too
