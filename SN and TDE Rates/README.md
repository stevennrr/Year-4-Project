(Week 1) Deep 2 Supernovae Rates.ipynb
-> Initial attempt at creating transient models of our SN rates (for const stellar mass and SFR)

(Week 2,3,4,5)DEEP2 SN Rates.ipynb
-> Additon of the TDE Rate equation and improving the code gradually(check history of the file)

(Week 6)Deep 2 Rates.ipynb and (Week 6)Deep2 Rates2.ipynb
-> Further improving the code to create more accurate rates. Creation of Log graphs too

(Week 7)Supernovae and TDE Rates v2.ipynb
-> Addition of 'cumulative' graphs for each rate

(Week 8,9,10,11 - Millennium)SN and TDE Rates and (Week 8,9,10,11 - GiggleZ)SN and TDE Rates 
-> Our algorithm to produce our rate plots for the Millennium and GiggleZ simulation

(Week 11 - Prelim)
-> Graphs used in our prelim report
